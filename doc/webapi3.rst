Interface Reference
--------------------------------------------

This section contains the reference for all functions used for the user-interface provided by DAQBroker. These documents leverage the the :ref:`webapi` calls to provide the (hopefully) easy to use interface also introduced in this chapter. These functions could also inspire other users looking to build or add their own features for the DAQBroker framework.
