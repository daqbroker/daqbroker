DAQBroker
=====================================

DAQBroker is a framework that intends to provide instrument monitoring and control in an open, simple and expandable fashion. This framework consists of a set of :doc:`server` written in the Python language, which are responsible for ensuring consistent and timely monitoring of each instrument created in the framework. Another important part of this framework is the :doc:`webapi` that allows users to interact with the instrument environment via HTTP commands or with a user-interface via browser. This document contains detailed information on all the different components of the framework.
